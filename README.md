# Challenge One - Addressing the Accessibility Requirements

In this challenge, as a front-end junior developer, I was exploring code refactoring to provide the appropriate syntaxis to the webpage without altering its original functionality. The objective of the challenge was to include the appropriate syntaxis elements to make the content of the website accessible for all users.

For this purpose, I was using different elements while coding such as:

```<head> <meta> <title> <body> <header> <nav> <main> <section> <article> <p> <figure> <aside> <footer>```

I also organized the semantic structure of the webpage to delimit the different sections with appropriate elements and make it easy to identify each element's position in the webpage. This ensures that people with disabilities and/or socio-economic restrictions have access to the website.

In addition, I tested and verified that all the links worked properly and cleaned the CSS coding to remove redundancy and make the code more compact. Finally, I added comments to indicate the changes and improvements made to the original code for better tracking of the proposed changes.
