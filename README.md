In this challenge, as a front-end junior developer, I was exploring how to provide the approppriate sintaxis to make the content of hte website accessible for all user. For this purpose, I was using different elements in while coding such as <head> <meta> <title> <body> <header> <nav> <main> <section> <article> <p> <figure> <aside> <footer> amongst others. This ensures that people with disabilities and/or socio-economic restrictions have access to the website.

In addition, I tested and verified that all the links worked properly and cleaned the CSS coding to remove redundancy and make the code more compact. This will make it easier to understand. I organized the semantic structure of the HTML file to delimit the different sections and make it easy to understand each element's position in the webpage. Finally, I added comments to indicate the changes and improvements made to the original code.
